### Intro
Hey everyone! As many of you might relate, I've been seeking a more efficient way to handle copying and pasting data from PR in Ariba and HowDoc.

My ultimate goal is to eliminate the repetitive and time-consuming task of manual copy-pasting in our day-to-day work life. I'm excited to share this journey with you all and look forward to your thoughts and feedback! 🌐💻🚀
